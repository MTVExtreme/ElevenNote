## Project

1. First Clone or Download the project and run it.

2. Once you reach the home screen log in.

3. Once logged in Click the note tab on the nav bar.

4. You should read a screen like this: (Without the notes and successful message)
![Home Screen](/Screenshots/1.PNG)

5. Next you want to click "Create New" this will allow you to create a note as such:
![Create New](/Screenshots/2.PNG)

6. Click Create to actually make the new note.

7. You should now see a screen with the note you just created. Ex:
![Added Note](/Screenshots/3.PNG)

8. If you would like to view the details of the note click "Details" You should see something like this:
![Details](/Screenshots/4.PNG)

9. You might notice the modified UTC is empty. Well it is supposed to be empty since we have yet to modify the note.

10. Lets go modify the note, this can be done 2 ways. You can either click the edit link on the details page, or if you are on the Index page you may click edit from there. Once you click edit something like this should appear:
![Edit](/Screenshots/5.PNG)

11. Edit the note as you see fit. Once your edit is complete click the Save button.

12. Once the note is saved open the details page again. (Note the modified UTC should now have a value)
![Details Edited](/Screenshots/6.PNG)

13. Click back to list to get back to the Index view.

14. Now if you would like to delete the note you just created click delete. Something like this should appear:
![Delete](/Screenshots/7.PNG)

15. Click delete and then accept and it'll take you to the Index View that looks like this:
![Item Gone](/Screenshots/9.PNG)

That is the majority of the MVC Application.
